The doors of the subway open like curtains.

Sitting on a cold steel beach, a woman is looking at a pigeon in absolute digust. 

People shift their weight, ready to get out of the crowded cart.

The pigeon is hopping towards a stale piece of bread next to the womans feet.

People pour onto the platform.

Scared by the sudden crowd, the pigeon makes a desperate jump and picks up the bread.

Commuters push themselves towards the escalators.

The woman **kicks**.

People gently force me to keep moving.

The pigeon sees the incoming foot and snaps its head around in panic.

I twist my neck, looking behind me.

The expression on the womans face changes instantly.

Righteous, disgusted anger is replaced with pure, wide-eyed terror.

The piece of bread, ripped out of the pigeons beak by inertia, is flying through the air, directly at her face.
