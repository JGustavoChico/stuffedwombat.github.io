FAQ:

**What types of games will you make?**

Most of my previous games are puzzle or skill based. I have some neat ideas in that direction that I want to explore.
But I am actually much more interested in telling short stories so I will try to do that as well.

**What happens if you dont make a game?**

I made one game per month in 2016 already, so I am confident that I can do it again. However, if I do not release a game in time, I will disable the patreon money collection thing.

**Why are there no special rewards for people who pledge more?**

I do not enjoy to gate content.
Even locking the game dev diaries behind a (admittedly very small) paywall makes me a bit uncomfortable.

**Will there be more rewards than just the diaries?**

Yes.
If I make a very small game (that I normally only show friends) or a prototype (that I do not finish), I will post it here for Patreon supporters.

**What happens if you release a commercial game?**

If that game is under my complete control, I might not make a free game and instead distribute keys to patreons.
If the game is not completely under my control, I will release a free game.

In periods where I am releasing something commercial, the risk of me not finsihing a game for Patreon is highest.
