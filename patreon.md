FAQ:

**How will the monthly games get released?**

I will upload them to newgrounds and itch.io, so you can play them directly in your browser.
They will be freely available for everyone to play.
If there is demand for it, I can also look into creating downloadable versions of the games for Patreons.



**What is a game dev diary?**

It is a document that describes the development process of a game.
It will contain gifs and pictures of the game in its various stages and talk about my intent and the process of trying to realise it.
Hopefully these documents will be usefull and interesting to you.
The first game dev diary will be made publicly available on the Patreon page.



**What types of games will you make?**

Most of my previous games are puzzle or skill based. 
I have some neat ideas in that direction that I want to explore.

But I am actually much more interested in telling short stories so I will try to do that as well.


**What happens if you dont make a game?**

I made one game per month in 2016 already, so I am confident that I can do it again. 
However, if I do not release a game in time, I will disable the patreon money collection thing for that month.


**Why are there no special rewards for people who pledge more?**

I do not enjoy to gate content.
Even locking the game dev diaries behind a (admittedly very small) paywall makes me a bit uncomfortable.


**Will there be more rewards than just the diaries?**

Yes.
If I make a very small game (that I normally only show friends) or a prototype (that I do not finish), I will post it on Patreon.


**What happens if you release a commercial game?**

If that game is under my complete control, I might not make a free game and instead distribute keys to patreons.
If the game is not completely under my control, I will release a free game.

In periods where I am releasing something commercial, the risk of me not finsihing a game for Patreon is highest.
