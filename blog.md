*14.Feb 2020* - **nice**

Sometimes I wake up and just feel good.<br>
On those mornings I enjoy the feeling of blankets on my skin. <br>
Stretching and rolling around lazily gives me a simple sensation of pleasure.<br>
<br>
I do not know why. <br>
<br>
It can happen at noon after a long night of drinking. <br>
Or when waking up confused at 7 pm after working a nightshift. <br>
Sometimes I feel it very early in the morning, when I should still be sleeping.<br>
<br>
On most days it does not happen.
