*15.Feb 2020* - **waiting**

It has been three months since I have send the pitchdeck for [Secret Project] to almost every publisher I know.<br>
One month ago one of them responded.<br>
<br>
I have still not heard anything from the others.<br>
Some of their websites and forms were broken, so maybe they are not looking for new games?<br>
<br>
The one that is interested in [Secret Project] has been extremely slow to reply to emails.<br>
I guess that that is just how it is.<br>
One can not expect a big company to act quickly.<br>
It does make me wonder:<br>
How many people are currently drifting in publishing limbo.<br>
<br>
How many people wake up everyday, only to check their emails forever?
<br>
<br>
I guess this is normal.<br>
It costs absolutely nothing for publisher to say "Yes thats interesting, let us stay in touch".<br>
For developers like me, who have no clue how buisness works, this is just frustrating and vague.<br>
I can not make plans for the future right now. <br>
I do not know if [Secret Project] will get picked up.<br>
<br>
I should probably inform myself about these things, but there is no time.<br>
I have to check my emails.<br>

*14.Feb 2020* - **nice**

Sometimes I wake up and just feel good.<br>
On those mornings I enjoy the feeling of blankets on my skin. <br>
Stretching and rolling around lazily gives me a simple sensation of pleasure.<br>
<br>
I do not know why. <br>
<br>
It can happen at noon after a long night of drinking. <br>
Or when waking up confused at 7 pm after working a nightshift. <br>
Sometimes I feel it very early in the morning, when I should still be sleeping.<br>
<br>
While it does not happen on most days, it at least happens sometimes now.<br>
