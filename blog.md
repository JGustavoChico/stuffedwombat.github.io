<h1>Blog</h1>
this is a test.<br>
i am documenting the developmet of a game here.<br>
if that does not distract me too much, i will keep writing about game dev related stuff.<br>
<br>
to save time i will not care that much about spelling.
<br>
the post on top is the newest one. <br>

<h1>01.03.20 - Starting [Always Down]</h1>

The place where I work has sent me on (paid) vacation because of COVID19.<br>
There is nothing to do for [Secret Project] except waiting for emails.<br>
<br>
So I am going to try (once more) to release a commercial game on steam in a month.
<br>
I have tried that a few times and always gave up pretty soon.<br>
Always because of lack of direction. I did not actually know what I wanted to make.<br>
I only knew that it should be """good""".
<br>
Yesterday I took took a "wobbly arms hold a gun" prototype and tried to make it easier to control.<br>
I ended up with a platforming shooter that felt pretty neat.<br>
<br>
I spent way too much time on making some physics based enemies to shoot at.<br>
I had some fun adding weird and huge guns for the character to hold, utilising the modularity of the code I wrote.<br>
Stuff like that (coding physics, making weird stuff) is always fun.<br>
<br>
But its also not really that productive when so much of the game is undefined.<br>
Once more I did not really know what I wanted the game to be, but this time I realised that early enough and stopped having fun.<br>
<br>
So, what the fuck is this going to be?<br>
Based on the movement, aiming and camerasystem I had already coded, I felt that the game should take place on a single screen.<br>
With the way the wobbly arms and gun was set up is what kind of hard to aim and having a wide level where stuff happens offscreen would just add to accuracy problems.<br>
<br>
Ok, so its going to be singlescreen.<br>
But thats boring.<br>
<br>
After doing some things that I can not remember, I came up with something pretty cool.<br>
When all the enemies on screen are dead, the floor dissapears and you drop down into the next room full of enemies.<br>
<br>
This is basically a fully realised gameplay loop and i like it very much.<br>
Oh yeah, I forgot to say: I thought that the "7 day roguelike" on itch.io (which I initially made the game for) was for action rogulikes (downwell, etg, etc).<br>
So from the start, I thought that the game contains randomly generated levels.<br>
That is pretty hard to code, but if I only have to randomly generate single rooms its doable.<br>
<br>
So having the player fluidly dropping into singlescreen room after singlescreen room makes coding the game easy, but it also feels cool with the physics based corpses of dead enemies. They ofc also fall down and over time you have this huge graveyard of dead things kind of "following" you as you go downwards.
<br>
Another cool thing about the singlescreen rooms is that the enemies do not have to navigate a very complicated space:<br>
Again, easy to code.<br>
<br>
After I had that "destroy floor when all enemies are dead" meachanic in, I felt for the first time that this could be a very small commercial game. It basically steals shamelessly from downwell and super crate box in some aspects but thats fine.<br>
<br>
It still felt a bit barren and boring, so i added a mechanic i prototypes 100 years ago:<br>
you have limited ammo and when a bullet hits a wall/enemie it turns into ammo that you can pick up again.<br>
(i think i unconsciously stole this from high hell)<br>
this old mechanic fits together perfectly with the breaking floors mechanic for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
I played around with some stuff and realised that time had passed much quicker than i thought. then i went to sleep.<br>
this is kind of turning into a diary? whatever :)<br>
<br>
I woke up today and hated the project immediatly.<br>
By using every ounce of selfcontrol i found withing myself i was able to force myself to sit down and do some little things on the game.<br>
i realised that there is no reason to hate it. it was just super undefined. I started to make a mental list of what the thing (bc at this point it was basically just a weird little blob of mechanics) lacked.<br>
<br>
I thought it lacked style (which is true). especially with Sludge Life announced i feel like i have been too comfy with my visual stuff.<br>
I made some shitty drawings, felt bad about my art skills and went to the last shift at work before my vacation.<br>
<br>
in the subway i wrote up the core loops of the game and planned some run/permanent upgrades and stuff like that.<br>
i recently experimented a lot with physics stuff, so i thought it would be cool to have achievemnts and game over screens and stuff like that represented as physical objects. then I had to get out of the subway.<br>
<br>
naturally, after a short time focusing on something else (in this case work), it clicked.<br>
I realised how I could utilise the things I had already made (and some things i had planned) to express something that I wanted to express for a long time.<br>
This is extremely important, because it basically makes every decision about everything super easy.<br>
Instead of asking myself if a mechanic, dynamic or aesthtic would be "cool" or "good", i can now just ask: "does this help express what i want to say?"<br>
The only hard thing left to do is to do some tests for each of those decisions and then pick the option that has the most overlap between "expresses the thing i want to say" and "i can make this very quickly".<br>
<br>
maybe you forgot, but i want to have this thing released on steam in a month from now.<br>
<br>
I dont want to talk about what (or how) i want to express with this game.<br>
expressing things through mechanics and like... play is still pretty new to me.<br>
It feels very private because I am extremely insecure about it.<br>
Also if i explain it, i ruin a cool moment for you :)<br>
<br>
Having found the thing I wanna say with the game, I was able to cut a lot of things (upgrades, items, etc) that I had previously included to satisfy convention.<br>
<br>
As I am typing this, I know pretty much exactly what I have to do this week.<br>
The concept of the game is done and i just need to make it real.<br>
Lets hope I do not wake up tomorrow and hate it.<br>
