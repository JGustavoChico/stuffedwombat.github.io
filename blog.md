<h1>01.03.20 - Starting [Always Down]</h1>

The place where I work has sent me on (paid) vacation because of COVID19.<br>
There is nothing to do for [Secret Project] except waiting for emails.<br>
<br>
So I am going to try (once more) to release a commercial game on steam in a month.
<br>
I have tried that a few times and always gave up pretty soon.<br>
Always because of lack of direction. I did not actually know what I wanted to make.<br>
I only knew that it should be """good""".
<br>
Yesterday I took took a "wobbly arms hold a gun" prototype and tried to make it easier to control.<br>
I ended up with a sidescrolling shooter that felt pretty neat.<br>
