<h2>How Gutwhale came to be</h2>
<br><br>
Gutwhale exists only because of the Corona Virus. After being forced to use up my vacattion days, I was fired from my job as a receptionist. 
<br><br>
After making small webgames, prototypes and gifs for the last five years, I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to try and quickly make a small commercial game.
<br><br>
When the protoype of Gutwhale showed promise, [Britt Brady](https://twitter.com/Britt_t_Brady) & [Franek](https://twitter.com/Franrekkk) joined the project. I know them both only through the internet and we made the game while practicing heavy social distancing, as each of us is on a different continent right now.
<br><br>
Development of Gutwhale went surprisingly smooth. The quality of my collaborateurs work helped me to push through and finish Gutwhale 5 weeks after I started.
<br><br>
We are very proud of what we accomplished and are really looking forward to seeing how the game is recieved!
