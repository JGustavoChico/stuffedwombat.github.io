<h1>Goodbye Gutwhale</h1>

Finally, almost 3 months after it released, I can stop thinking about Gutwhale.<br>
This text is an edited transcript of a talk I have for the Game Dev Days 2020.

A few years ago all i did was gamejams.<br> 
Gamejams are essentially deadlines forcing you finish something. <br>
In addition to the normal Jams, I did a lot of short jams alone where i would sit down and give myself 30 minutes to make a prototype.<br>
Many of the gifs I post on twitter are the results of these short solo jams.<br> 
<br>
This helped me to learn to code and to design and to schedule, but over time I found that simply making stuff was not enough anymore.<br>
What i really love is doing something new. <br>
Something that has not existed before.<br>
Finding a new angle on an old problem brings me an intense, deep joy that is really hard to describe.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of unexplored space in games and what I am currently really interested in is **expression**:<br>
How do I tell a story through a game? <br
How do I communicate how I feel through videogames? <br>
Its really hard and kind of stupid, considering that videogames are all about endless repetition in closed systems, but its what i want to explore right now.<br>
<br>

There is a game developer called [miziziziz](https://twitter.com/miziziziz), one of the few who makes watchable youtube videos, 
who made a commercial game called [Theyes Thou](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1232330/Theyest_Thou) in one month.<br>
