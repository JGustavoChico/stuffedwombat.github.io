# useful hell

Twitter is keeping me from making games.

When I first signed up, it was this wonderful place, full of people I wanted to interact with, full of potential appreciation for my games, a place full of promise.

Now it still is all of these things, but whenever I am finding myself with a second to spare, my hands autmatically switch tabs and click on the tiny blue bell and I find myself, half an hour later, scrolling and not enjoying my time at all.

I have become addicted and I want to quit.
Through this text, I hope to break that addiction.
Or at least weaken it.
I do not want to leave completely.

**getting started**

Twitter has been incredibly useful to me.
I got job offers, connections to publishers and developers and met people I now call friends through it.

When I started to make games, I had incredibly low self esteem. While I am not a confidence bomb now, the fact that a lot of people have seen and enjoyed my work still helps me in some darker hours.

>  Likes and retweets make me feel good about myself. How do I get more? 

**use twitter**

Here are some tactics that I have been using to get people to interact with my content.

- Do not use hashtags

  - People do not enjoy reading. Hashtags increase the amount of text in a tweet.

    Some people might check #gamedev to see what is happening, but the majority of users just scroll through their feed, looking for cool stuff.

    People with a lot of reach rarely use hashtags because they do no have to. I think that by emulating that confidence, you can, just like in real life, reap its benefits.

    > My most widely shared tweet has no hashtag at all in it.

    I believe that hashtags are useless. I have no data to back that up. I believe it though. 

    The only exceptions for me are #screenshotsaturday and #LDjam. 
    To me, they are able convey an actual feeling of community and togetherness and are the only hashtags I check out.

    ​

- Tell stories through gifs

  - People like stories. You can tell a story through a gif.
    I use a narrative structure called Kishotenketsu to make my gifs. It consists of 4 story beats.

    > Let us assume that you have made a platformer and want to show it off to the world.
    > ​
    > **Step 1: Introduce**
    >
    > Give your audience time to take in the world you created.
    > Start the gif in a stressfree environment and establish what the player controls and how they control it:
    > Run around a little and show how high you can jump.
    >
    > Remeber that these core mechanics are entirely clear to you, but not to people seeing your game for the first time. 
    >
    > ​
    >
    > **Step 2: Develop**
    >
    > Introduce a challenge that can be overcome with what you have learned in step one. 
    > A pit full of spikes, spawing enemies, a tough decision to make or a coin in a high place will make your audience anticipate the conclusion.
    >
    > Again, give your viewers some time to take in the obstacle.
    >
    > ​
    >
    > **Step 3: Subvert**
    >
    > Your audience expects the solution to the problem you introduced.
    > They are not going to get it just yet.
    > Depending on your game, this means that the character falls into the pit, gets hit by an enemie or misses the coin.
    > Failure is an important part of most stories and will make it more satisfying when the obstacle is overcome.
    >
    > Here, you show the consequences of not using your games systems efficiently. 
    > Give the audience a short time to comprehend the effects of failing before rallying your spirits and moving on to step 4.
    >
    > ​
    >
    > **Step 4: Conclude**
    >
    > You have set up the stage, you have shown what you can do and you have failed.
    > Now it is time to bring the gif to an end.
    > Using the mechanics of your game efficiently, the character can now overcome the challenge.
    >
    > But ending directly after the goals has been achieved is too sudden. Gifs are looping endlessly on twitter and you do not want to start your story again just yet.
    > Add a short time of stilness, to allow people to exit the world of your game.
    > It is important for people to recognise the end of your gif, so that they can feel that they just witnessed something complete.

- be fast & creative

  - People like interesting content. Spending weeks on polishing your game might be good for a commercial release, but prototypes can do extremely well on twitter.

    Not every gif you make will be great, especially when starting out. Over the last year, I have become pretty fast at making gameideas work quickly.
    Sometimes I even just throw some code together for the gif alone and then play puppet theater, carefull controlling the character, so that it does not break the illusion of a working prototype.

    Having a unqiue gameplay mechanic and communicating it well is worth a lot of retweets.
    Who needs working code or a solid gameplay loop when you can have retweets and likes?
    And that is what we want. Retweets and likes. Forever.



**get used by twitter**

Here I will describe how twitter slowly took over my life.

- Everything, right now, forever

  - There is a lot of debating to be done about games. There are the newest news to react to, hot takes to be made and controversial gaming opinions to be held.

    Luckily I have always been to shy and uncertain to participate in the discussions surruonding videogames on twitter. But I have been following the discourse for years now.

    I thought that all this information was important to have. Surely there have to be some golden opportunity waiting behind the next refresh.
    The shitty thing is, that sometimes there is usefull information to be had and sometimes there are great opportunities popping up in my feed.

    BUT

    I never really questioned how much more usefull information and how much more opportunities came to me through actually making games.
    And I kept scrolling.

- Your self worth is now a function of likes

  - When using tactics to boost your ego, that ego will be linked to these tactics.
    When a tweet did well, I felt good about myself, when it did poorly, I felt bad about myself.
    That is not really a sustainable way of living. What if the Wifi stops working?

    While in the beginning it was great to see people liking, sharing and talking about my work, like any addiction, twitter has dimishing returns.

    A few months ago, I would be sad if a tweet got less than a hundred likes.
    A few years ago, a hundred likes made my week.

    ​

- Your developement process is now a function of likes

  - If you want to keep the appreciation coming in, you have to keep coming up with new things, you have to keep surprising your audience, you have to constantly perform.
    That causes stress. 
    It caused me to start 6 prototypes in one day, then delete them all and go to sleep, feeling like shit.
    It kept me from actually finishing games. 
    It is a lot  easier to quickly record a gif of a game that is fun to *watch* than to develop a game that is fun to *play*.

    ​

**Getting away from twitter**

Twitter helped me a lot. I met great friends through it. I got contacts and business opportunities through it.
But it has taken over my life.

I want to get better at making games.
To do that, I have to make a lot of games and my twitter addiction is keeping me from doing that.

I can not bring myself to completely dissapear from the platform, so here I will publicly lay down some rules for myself, hoping that I will be able to follow them:

- Log off
  - This will create a barrier, forcing me to manually log in
- Check deliberatley
  - Everyday I will have 20 minutes set aside for twitter. 10 in the morning and 10 in the evening.
- Only tweet about finished projects
  - I will only tweet to announce the release of a game, text or whatever.
    If you want to ask me something, my DMs are open.

I really hope that this helps me to get away.
There are so many cool projects to work on, hopefully I will be able to share them with you soon!
