Heyo.

I never went to design school and sometimes it takes me a very long time to understand simple things.

This text is about is a neat thing that helps me to keep track of what I am doing.

# The three ways of designing games

This is a tool.
Here is how you use it:

Examine how you are designing.
Compare that to the three ways of designing games:

- stealing
- exploring
- working

Think about what you want to do with your life. 

If you are happy about how things are going, continue. 

If not, try to change some stuff.


Here is more info on the three ways of desiging games:

## stealing

Stealing is pretty cool. You just copy someone elses design.

Compared to the other ways of designing games, stealing is relatively comfortable.
Thieves know exactly where they want to go.

They start with something that already exists and then work their way towards it.

Still, they are often sad, because they feel that their work is not unique enough.
In my experience, many sad thieves are very excited about a game design ajacent craft, like coding or drawing. They prefer to be creative in these areas and that is super ok, but they still beat themselves up about not being original enough.

They should probably go explore.

## exploring

Exploring is amazing. The horizon is endless.

Compared to the other ways of designing games, exploring is reckless.
Explorters have no guarantee of actually ending up somewhere.
They also can get lost and sometimes never return.

Explorers start from a familiar point and head off, out into the unknown.

Explorers are often frustrated, because they never seem to find anything.
In my experience, frustrated explorers are often generalists, people who have lowered their standards or can both draw and code. They see potential everywhere, but are not equipped to actually work with what they find and often leave everything behind to go exploring again.

They should probably learn how to work.

## work

Work is straightforwad. You know where you want to go.

Compared to the other ways of designing games, work is pretty boring.
Workers are not trying to replicate something that existed before. They are also not forever looking for something more interesting.

Workers have their own clear goal and they work towards it.

In my personal experience, workers are people who have a lot of experience in stealing, exploring and life in general.
They have designed a few released games and possess intuition and confidence. Workers believe in what they want to make, steal what they can and invent the rest.

They should probably take a vacation.



# important notes

This is a tool, not a theory. I have no clue if this makes any sense to anyone but me. 
Simply asking myself wether I am currently stealing, exploring or working helps me to adjust course when necessary.

Game design is only one of many parts of game development and all of the parts are very important. 

The three ways of designing games are all equal in their validitiy. Neither is "better" than any other.
They simply have different ramifications.

We are all constantly stealing very basic things: Control schemes, common basic shapes, moving platforms. Do no understimate the power and necessity of theft.

Work requires insane mental strength.  

Exploration is really fun.
